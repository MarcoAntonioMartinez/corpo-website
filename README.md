# Corporate Website Project
Recreation of a landing page for a corporation following a tutorial found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppu-3sOO07o

Some changes I made so far include: 
- Close approximation of a background was made for the service and about sections
- All other sections had images replaced with ones found on Unsplash (attributions will be displayed through tooltips)
- CSS for about section images had to be adjusted to be more similar to those in the tutorial
- Icons from boxicon library had to be picked from website as video is a little outdated

Changes that need to be implemented:
- CSS needs to be adjusted to accomadate larger screen resolutions
- Attributions for Unsplash images
